## Description

There are some QOL features implemented to reduce the number of steps needed to construct an expression.

1. If two operands and an operator are defined, clicking an operator will override the current operator.

2. Delete will only delete the right most digit.

3. If an answer is displayed:
   * Clicking an operator will take the answer and construct a new expression consisting of the answer and operator.
   * Clicking an operand will construct a new expression with just the operand defined.
   * Clicking negation will take the answer and construct an expression consisting of the negated answer.
   * Clicking delete will delete the answer and second operand, leaving just the original, first operand and operator.

4. The calculator accepts keyboard input as well. The table below outlines the keyboard shortcuts that match the calculators
numpad buttons.
